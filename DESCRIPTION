Title: Hierarchal clustering of geographic object with contiguity constraints

Description: geohclust offers two functions geohclust_poly and geohclust_graph that enable the clustering of spatial data such as polygons with a hclust type approach but taking advantages of contiguity constraints. The contiguities naturaly create a sparsely connected graph that can be leveraged to speed-up the calculations and deal with more than 30000 polygons in seconds.

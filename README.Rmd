# geohclust

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

geohclust offers two functions `?geohclust_poly` and `?geohclust_graph` that enable the clustering of spatial data such as polygons with a hclust type approach but taking advantages of contiguity constraints. The contiguity naturally create a sparsely connected graph that can be leveraged to speed-up the calculations and deal with more than 30000 polygons in seconds.    

## Installation

You can install the development version of geohclust from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("comeetie/geohclust")
```

## Example

This is a basic example, we first prepare some spatial polygons data, here the results at the municipality level in one french department for the  :

```{r example-data,message=FALSE}
library(geohclust)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
data("pres2022_t1_communes")
deplist = c(37)
dep = pres2022_t1_communes |> 
  filter(INSEE_DEP %in% deplist) |>
  select(p_gauche,p_droite,p_extreme_droite) |>
  filter(!is.na(p_gauche))
```


Do the clustering and use the classical function from `?hclust` (`?plot.hclust` and `?cutree`):

```{r clustering,fig.show='hold',out.width="100%",fig.width=18,fig.height=8}
hc=geohclust_poly(dep)
plot(hc)
cutree(hc,k=30) |> head(20)
```


You may also use the `?geocutree` function which build directly a spatial data.frame with the clustering results: 
```{r plot}
plot(geocutree(hc,k=30))
```
